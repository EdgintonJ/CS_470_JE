Project 02: Wordle


The following is the software needed/used:
	Javascript
	Webstorm

No packages outside of NodeJS, React and Mui were used
		

Notes:
	I did not align the keyboard correctly like in the actual game, instead I put enter and backspace 
	in areas where they would not seem "out of order."

	Just like project 1, I feel like I didn't do this the way it was 100% intended (I am getting the 
	hang of arrow functions now though). I didn't notice the 2nd video in the 2/17 lecture... so my
	structure is closer to the previous video's code.

	My iterating through activeRow for each letter was... brutish, I ran into some problems and... 
	handled them similarly (I named that variable appropriately), and lastly my keyboard was... 
	not elegant in the slightest. All and all though, the game works and I learned a lot 
	(I'm actually a bit interested in what's next).
